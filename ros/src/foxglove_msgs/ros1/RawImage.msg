# Timestamp of image
time timestamp

# Frame of reference for the image. The origin of the frame is the optical center of the camera. +x points to the right in the image, +y points down, and +z points into the plane of the image.

# Image width in pixels
uint32 width

# Image heigh in pixels
uint32 height

# Encoding of the raw image data
string encoding

# Byte length of a single row. This is usually some multiple of `width` depending on the encoding, but can be greater to incorporate padding.
uint32 step

# Raw image data.
# 
# Pixels should be encoded in one of the supported encodings:
# - `yuv422`,  `uyvy`: [Y'UV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%E2%80%B2UV), one byte per component.
#   U and V values are shared between horizontal pairs of pixels. Each pair of output pixels is encoded as [U, Y1, V, Y2].
#   `step` must be greater than or equal to `width` * 2.
# - `yuv422_yuy2`,  `yuyv`: [Y'UV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y%E2%80%B2UV), one byte per component.
#   U and V values are shared between horizontal pairs of pixels. Each pair of output pixels is encoded as [Y1, U, Y2, V].
#   `step` must be greater than or equal to `width` * 2.
# - `rgb8`: 8-bit RGB. Each output pixel is encoded as [R, G, B].
#   `step` must be greater than or equal to `width` * 3.
# - `rgba8`: 8-bit RGB + Alpha. Each output pixel is encoded as [R, G, B, Alpha].
#   `step` must be greater than or equal to `width` * 4.
# - `bgr8`: RGB, one byte per component. Each output pixel is encoded as [B, G, R].
#   `step` must be greater than or equal to `width` * 3.
# - `bgra8`, `8UC3`: RGB + Alpha, one byte per component. Each output pixel is encoded as [B, G, R, Alpha].
#   `step` must be greater than or equal to `width` * 4.
# - `32FC1`: 32-bit little-endian IEEE754 float brightness values, from 0.0 (black) to 1.0 (white).
#   `step` must be greater than or equal to `width` * 4.
# - `bayer_rggb8`, `bayer_bggr8`, `bayer_rggb8`, `bayer_gbrg8`, `bayer_grgb8`: 8-bit RGB 2x2 Bayer pattern.
#   The order of the four letters after `bayer_` determine the layout, so for `bayer_wxyz8` the pattern is:
#   w | x
#   - | -
#   y | z
#   `step` must be greater than or equal to `width`.
# - `mono8`, `8UC1`: 8-bit brightness values from 0 (black) to 255 (white).
#   `step` must be greater than or equal to `width`.
# - `mono16`, `16UC1`: 16-bit values whose effect is determined in [Image panel color mode settings](https://docs.foxglove.dev/docs/visualization/panels/image#general).
#   `step` must be greater than or equal to `width` * 2.
