# foxglove_msgs/Grid
# A 2D grid of data

# Generated by https://github.com/foxglove/foxglove-sdk

# Timestamp of grid
time timestamp

# Frame of reference
string frame_id

# Origin of grid's corner relative to frame of reference; grid is positioned in the x-y plane relative to this origin
geometry_msgs/Pose pose

# Number of grid columns
uint32 column_count

# Size of single grid cell along x and y axes, relative to `pose`
foxglove_msgs/Vector2 cell_size

# Number of bytes between rows in `data`
uint32 row_stride

# Number of bytes between cells within a row in `data`
uint32 cell_stride

# Fields in `data`. `red`, `green`, `blue`, and `alpha` are optional for customizing the grid's color.
foxglove_msgs/PackedElementField[] fields

# Grid cell data, interpreted using `fields`, in row-major (y-major) order â€” values fill each row from left to right along the X axis, with rows ordered from top to bottom along the Y axis, starting at the bottom-left corner when viewed from +Z looking towards -Z with identity orientations
