# C++ library

The Foxglove C++ SDK is a higher-level wrapper around the [C library](../c). To build it, you will need to link with that library and add the [generated includes](../c/include) to your include paths.

## Local development

Build the library and examples:

```
make build
```

Build and run tests:

```
make test
```

Run with Address & Undefined Behavior sanitizers:

```
make SANITIZE=address,undefined test
```

Run example programs (note that a different `build` directory may be used depending on build settings like sanitizers):

```
./build/example_server
```
