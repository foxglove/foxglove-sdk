# The ROS docker images are only updated when the underlying
# Ubuntu layer changes; this is a limitation of being an
# "official" docker image.  Additionally, ROS packages do
# not have minimum dependency requirements.  That is,
# ROS package "A" may have a dependency on "B", but it cannot
# easily specify what version of "B" that it needs.
# However, the latest versions of the ROS packages
# are always expected to work together.
#
# This means that we *always* have to do an
# "apt-get dist-upgrade" before we install dependencies
# with "make deps" below (which calls "rosdep install").
# That ensures that we have the latest versions of the
# ROS packages in the underlay and for what is installed
# by rosdep.
