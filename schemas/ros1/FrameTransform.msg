# foxglove_msgs/FrameTransform
# A transform between two reference frames in 3D space. The transform describes the position and orientation of the child frame relative to the parent frame.

# Generated by https://github.com/foxglove/foxglove-sdk

# Timestamp of transform
time timestamp

# Name of the parent frame
string parent_frame_id

# Name of the child frame
string child_frame_id

# Translation component of the transform: the position of the child frame's origin within the parent frame.
# 
# For example, a FrameTransform with a translation of (1, 0, 0) and an identity rotation means that a point at (0, 0, 0) in the child frame is at (1, 0, 0) in the parent frame.
geometry_msgs/Vector3 translation

# Rotation component of the transform: the orientation of the child frame's axes relative to the parent frame
geometry_msgs/Quaternion rotation
