# foxglove_msgs/msg/FrameTransform
# A transform between two reference frames in 3D space. This transform can be used to convert the coordinates of a point from the child frame to the parent frame.

# Generated by https://github.com/foxglove/foxglove-sdk

# Timestamp of transform
builtin_interfaces/Time timestamp

# Name of the parent frame
string parent_frame_id

# Name of the child frame
string child_frame_id

# Translation component of the transform: the position of the child frame's origin expressed in the parent frame.
# 
# To convert a point P from the child frame to the parent frame, first apply the rotation and then add the translation: P_parent = rotation * P_child + translation.
# 
# Example 1: With translation (1, 0, 0) and identity rotation, a point at (0, 0, 0) in the child frame maps to (1, 0, 0) in the parent frame.
# 
# Example 2: With translation (1, 2, 0) and a 90-degree rotation around the z-axis (quaternion x=0, y=0, z=0.707, w=0.707), a point at (1, 0, 0) in the child frame maps to (1, 3, 0) in the parent frame.
