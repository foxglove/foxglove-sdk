  /// 1. With translation (x=1, y=0, z=0) and identity rotation (x=0, y=0, z=0, w=1), a point at (x=0, y=0, z=0) in the child frame maps to (x=1, y=0, z=0) in the parent frame.

  /// 2. With translation (x=1, y=2, z=0) and a 90-degree rotation around the z-axis (x=0, y=0, z=0.707, w=0.707), a point at (x=1, y=0, z=0) in the child frame maps to (x=-1, y=3, z=0) in the parent frame.
