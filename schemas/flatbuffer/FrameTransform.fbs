/// A transform between two reference frames in 3D space. The transform defines the position and orientation of a child frame within a parent frame. Translation moves the origin of the child frame relative to the parent origin. The rotation changes the orientiation of the child frame around its origin.
/// 
/// Examples:
/// 
/// - With translation (x=1, y=0, z=0) and identity rotation (x=0, y=0, z=0, w=1), a point at (x=0, y=0, z=0) in the child frame maps to (x=1, y=0, z=0) in the parent frame.
/// 
/// - With translation (x=1, y=2, z=0) and a 90-degree rotation around the z-axis (x=0, y=0, z=0.707, w=0.707), a point at (x=1, y=0, z=0) in the child frame maps to (x=-1, y=3, z=0) in the parent frame.
