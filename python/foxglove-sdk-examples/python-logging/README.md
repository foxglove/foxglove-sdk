# Python logging configuration

An example from the Foxglove SDK.

The `foxglove` module provides a `set_log_level` function for convenience in scripts, but for more
involved applications you'll likely want to configure logging yourself. Most examples use the former
for simplicity; this example demonstrates some logging configuration which might be more typical of
real-world usage.

## Usage

This example uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
uv run python main.py
```
